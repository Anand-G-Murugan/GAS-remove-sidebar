# GAS-remove-sidebar
The GAS sidebar and cookie box often are annoying when coding. This is some small javascript code that can be saved as a bookmark to delete them.

## Setup

* In whichever browser you are using, create a ew bookmrak.
* Name the bookmark as per your liking.
* For the "address" or "URL" part, copy the javascript code from detelor.js and paste it there.
* Save your bookmark.

Now, when you open GAS, you can click on the bookmark to run the code and delete the elements from your page.

## Note
You can refresh the page at any time if you wish to load the elements again.
